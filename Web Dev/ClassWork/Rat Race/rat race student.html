<!--
	STEP 1
	Program the Run the button
	
	A click of the button will call the runLap function.  Write the runLap function.
	
	STEP 2
	Display the value of each mouse.
	
	STEP 3
	getRandomInteger
	
	In order to work through the algorithm, you need to consider the different conditions that might exist.
	
	Generating a number from 0 to x is parseInt(Math.random() * (x + 1))
	What about generating a number from 1 to x?
	What about generating a number from x to y?
	What about generating a number from -x to y?
	
	Is there a single formula that can cover all of these conditions or do you need to handle them individually?

	STEP 4
	Using the new random function.
	
	Update the runLaps function so that it uses getRandomInteger().
	
	STEP 5
	The race should run for 10 laps.  After 10 laps, we can determine a winner.
	
	Create a variable that keeps track of the number of laps and a constant that says which lap is the last one.  
	
	Once the number of laps reaches that final number, the race should not continue, even if the player presses the button.
	
	Don't forget to display the lap number.
	
	STEP 6
	Formalized Display - Find the Leader
	
	Based on the lap number, the program should either say who is in the lead or it should say who won the race.
	
	A function should be written to determine which mouse is in the lead.  What parameters does it need?  What should it return?
	
	STEP 7
	Formalized Display - format the lap number.
	
	The output should read something like this:
	
	After the 6th lap, Mickey is in the lead.
	
	The lap number comes from the variable and the lead mouse comes from the function you wrote in Step 6.  What about the suffix for the number ("th")?
	
	Write a getNumericSuffix() function that takes a number and determines the proper suffix for it, creating a string with the number and the suffix (like 6th or 1st).  What parameters do you need?  What are the special cases?
	
	STEP 8
	Create the Javascript file.
	
	In order to make Javascript code portable, you can create a separate Javascript file with the extension .js.
	
	A Javascript file should have ONLY Javascript code in it.
	
	Take the getRandomInteger() and getNumericSuffix() functions and place them in a file called utilities.js.  This file is now something that can be imported into any HTML file.  This way, we never have to write these functions again, simply move a copy of the file into our root (or some other place along the path).

	In order to import the file into the HTML file, you use a <script> tag.
	The <script> tag needs a src attribute (like an <img /> tag) whose value is the file you're importing.
	The <script> tag must have a closing </script> tag.
	There may be NO CODE between the opening and closing tags.  If you need additional code, use a separate <script> tag.
